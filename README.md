# Gnomix Pretrained Models from LARGE-PD
Pretrained models from Gnomix used in the LARGE-PD paper.

## LARGE-PD Phase 2
Pretrained model panel and list of variants for the LARGE-PD Phase 2 data. This panel is composed of samples from the 1000 Genomes 30x dataset, using the references from Shriner et al. 2023 (PMID: PMC10507155, doi:10.1016/j.xhgg.2023.100235), and non-admixed Native American samples from LARGE-PD Phase 2, genotyped using the Illumina NeuroBooster array.
